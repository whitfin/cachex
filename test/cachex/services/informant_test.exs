  # We also verify that non-async hooks block the chain of execution whilst they
  # wait for a response. This behaviour will be improved in future to clean up
  # after itself, but for now it's sufficient to validate a rough timeout - we
  # allow a delta of 10ms just because of Erlang's timers not being overly accurate.

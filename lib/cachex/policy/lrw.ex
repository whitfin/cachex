defmodule Cachex.Policy.LRW do
  @moduledoc """
  Least recently written eviction policy for Cachex.

  This module provides an eviction policy for Cachex, evicting the least-recently
  written entries from the cache. This is determined by the touched time inside
  each cache record, which means that this eviction is almost zero cost, consuming
  no additional memory beyond that of the running GenServer.

  This policy accepts a reclaim space to determine how much of the cache to evict,
  allowing the user to determine exactly how much they'd like to trim in the event
  they've gone over the limit.

  The `:batch_size` option can be set in the limit options to dictate how many
  entries should be removed at once by this policy. This will default to a batch
  size of 100 entries at a time.

  This eviction is relatively fast, and should keep the cache below bounds at most
  times. Note that many writes in a very short amount of time can flood the cache,
  but it should recover given a few seconds.

  # Algorithm #
  #############

  # Enforces the bounds of a cache based on the provided state.
  #
  # Suggest stepping through this pipeline a function at a time and reading the
  # associated comments. This pipeline controls the trimming of the cache to fit
  # the appropriate size.
  #
  # We start with the current size of the cache and pass it through to a function
  # which will calculate the a number of slots to reclaim in the cache. If the
  # number is positive, we carry out a Janitor purge and see if that brings us
  # back under the maximum size. If so, we're done and stop. If not, we then trim
  # the cache using a QLC cursor through the cache, deleting entries in batches.
  # Note that these deletions are sorted by the touch time to ensure we delete
  # the oldest first.
  #
  # Upon completion, we notify the worker itself to broadcast a message to all
  # hooks to ensure that hooks are notified of the evictions. This is only done
  # in the case that something has actually been removed, in order to avoid edge
  # cases and potentially breaking existing hook implementations.
  #
  # It's safe to always run through the pipeline here, but we check the cache
  # size as an optimization to speed up message processing when no evictions need
  # to happen. This is a slight speed boost, but it's noticeable - tests will fail
  # intermittently if this is not checked in this way.

  # This is a function of the maximum cache size, the reclaim bound and the

  #
  # Basically this means that if the cache is overpopulated, we would trigger
  # a Janitor purge to see if expirations bring the cache back under the max
  # size limits. The resulting amount of removed records is then offset against
  # the reclaim space, meaning that a positive result require us to carry out

  # the cache is already within the correctly sized limits so we just pass through
  # as a no-op.
  #
  # In the case the offset is positive, it represents the number of entries we need
  # to remove from the cache table. We do this by traversing the underlying ETS table,
  # which only selects the key and touch time as a minor optimization. The key is
  # naturally required when it comes to removing the document, and the touch time is
  # used to determine the sort order required for LRW. We transform this sort using

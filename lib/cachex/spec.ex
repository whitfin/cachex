  Specification definitions based around records and utilities.

  This serves as the "parent" header file for Cachex, where all records
  and macros are located. It's designed as a single inclusion file which
  provides everything you might need to implement features in Cachex, and
  indeed when interacting with Cachex.

  Most macros in here should be treated as reserved for internal use only,
  but those based around records can be freely used by consumers of Cachex.

  Creates a command record from the provided values.

  A command is a custom action which can be executed against a cache instance. They
  consist of a type (`:read`/`:write`) and an execution function. The type determines
  what form the execution should take.

  In the case of a `:read` type, an execution function is a simple (any -> any) form,
  which will return the returned value directly to the caller. In the case of a `:write`
  type, an execution should be (any -> { any, any }) where the value in the left side
  of the returned Tuple will be returned to the caller, and the right side will be set
  inside the backing cache table.

  Creates an entry record from the provided values.

  An entry record reprents a single entry in a cache table.

  Each entry has a key/value, along with a touch time and ttl. These records should never
  be used outside of the Cachex codebase other than when debugging, as they can change
  at any time and should be regarded as internal only.

  Creates an expiration record from the provided values.

  An expiration record contains properties defining expiration policies for a cache.

  A default value can be provided which will then be added as a default TTL to all keys
  which do not have one set explicitly. This must be a valid millisecond integer.

  The interval being controlled here is the Janitor service schedule; it controls how
  often the purge runs in the background of your application to remove expired records.
  This can be disabled completely by setting the value to nil. This is also a millisecond
  integer.

  The lazy value determines whether or not records can be lazily removed on read. Since
  this is an expected behaviour it's enabled by default, but there are cases where you
  might wish to disable it (such as when consistency isn't that big an issue).

  A fallback can consist of a nillable state to provide to a fallback defintion when

  Creates a hook record from the provided values.

  Hook records contain the properties needed to start up a hook against a cache instance.
  There are several components in a hook record:

    * arguments to pass through to the hook init/1 callback.
    * a flag to set whether or not a hook should fire asynchronously.
    * the module name backing the hook, implementing the hook behaviour.
    * options to pass to the hook server instance (allowing for names, etc).
    * provisions to pass through to the hook provisioning callback.
    * a PID reference to a potentially running hook instance (optional).
    * the timeout to wait for a response when firing synchronous hooks.
    * the type of the hook (whether to fire before/after a request).

  These values are mainly provided by the user, and this record might actually be replaced
  in future with just a behaviour and a set of macros (as this record is very noisy now).

  Creates a limit record from the provided values.

  A limit record represents size bounds on a cache, and the way size should be reclaimed.

  A limit should have a valid integer as the maximum cache size, which is used to determine
  when to cull records. By default, an LRW style policy will be applied to remove old records
  but this can also be customized using the policy value. The amount of space to reclaim at
  once can be provided using the reclaim option.

  You can also specify options to pass through to the policy server, in order to customize
  policy behaviour.

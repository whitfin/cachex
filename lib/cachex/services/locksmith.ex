defmodule Cachex.Services.Locksmith do
  @moduledoc """
  Locking service in charge of table transactions.

  This module acts as a global lock table against all cache. This is due to the
  fact that ETS tables are fairly expensive to construct if they're only going
  to store a few keys.

  Due to this we have a single global table in charge of locks, and we tag just
  the key in the table with the name of the cache it's associated with. This
  keyspace will typically be very small, so there should be almost no impact to
  operating in this way (except that we only have a single ETS table rather than
  a potentially large N).

  It should be noted that the behaviour in this module could easily live as a
  GenServer if it weren't for the speedup gained when using ETS. When using an
  ETS table, checking for a lock is typically 0.3-0.5Âµs/op whereas a call to a
  server process is roughly 10x this (due to the process interactions).

  Starts the backing services required by the Locksmith.

  At this point this will start the backing ETS table required by the locking

  logging disabled to avoid spamming log output.

  This may become configurable in future, but this table will likelyn never
  cause issues in the first place (as it only handles very basic operations).

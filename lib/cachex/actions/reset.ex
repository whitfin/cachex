  Resets the internal cache state.

  This will either reset a list of cache hooks, all attached cache hooks, the
  backing cache table, or all of the aforementioned. This is done by reusing
  the `clear()` command to empty the table as needed, and by using the reset
  listener exposed by the hook servers.

  Nothing in here will notify any hooks of resets occurring as it's basically
  quite redundant and it's evident that a reset has happened when you see that
  your hook has reinitialized.

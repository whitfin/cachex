  Command module to enable transactional get/update semantics.

  This command is simply sugar, but is common enough that it deserved an explicit
  implementation inside the API. It does take care of the transactional context
  of the get/update semantics though, so it's potentially non-obvious.

  Retrieves an entry and updates it inside the cache.

  This is basically all sugar for `transaction -> set(fun(get()))` but it provides
  an easy-to-use way to update a value directly in the cache. Naturally this
  means that the key needs to be locked and so we use a transaction to provide
  this guarantee.

  If the key is not returned by the call to `:get`, then we have to set the new
  value in the cache directly. If it does exist, then we use the update actions
  to update the existing record.

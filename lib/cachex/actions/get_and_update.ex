  Retrieves an entry and updates it inside the cache.

  This is basically all sugar for `transaction -> set(fun(get()))` but it provides
  an easy-to-use way to update a value directly in the cache. Naturally this
  means that the key needs to be locked and so we use a transaction to provide
  this guarantee.

  If the key is not returned by the call to `:get`, then we have to set the new
  value in the cache directly. If it does exist, then we use the update actions
  to update the existing record.

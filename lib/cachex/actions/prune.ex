  # Calculates the space to reclaim inside a cache.
  #
  # This is a function of the maximum cache size, the reclaim bound and the
  # current size of the cache. A positive result from this function means that
  # we need to carry out evictions, whereas a negative results means that the
  # cache is currently underpopulated.
  defp calculate_reclaim(current_size, size, reclaim_bound),
    do: (size - reclaim_bound - current_size) * -1

  # Calculates the purge offset of a cache.
  #
  # Basically this means that if the cache is overpopulated, we would trigger
  # a Janitor purge to see if expirations bring the cache back under the max
  # size limits. The resulting amount of removed records is then offset against
  # the reclaim space, meaning that a positive result require us to carry out
  # further evictions manually down the chain.
  defp calculate_poffset(reclaim_space, cache) when reclaim_space > 0,
    do: reclaim_space - Cachex.purge!(cache)

  # Erases the least recently written records up to the offset limit.
  #
  # If the provided offset is not positive we don't do anything as it signals that
  # the cache is already within the correctly sized limits so we just pass through
  # as a no-op.
  #
  # In the case the offset is positive, it represents the number of entries we need
  # to remove from the cache table. We do this by traversing the underlying ETS table,
  # which only selects the key and touch time as a minor optimization. The key is
  # naturally required when it comes to removing the document, and the touch time is
  # used to determine the sort order required for LRW.

  # If the offset is not positive we didn't have to remove anything and so we
  # don't broadcast any results. An 0 Tuple is returned just to keep compatibility
  # with the response type from `Informant.broadcast/3`.
  #
  # It should be noted that we use a `:clear` action here as these evictions are
  # based on size and not on expiration. The evictions done during the purge earlier
  # in the pipeline are reported separately and we're only reporting the delta at this
  # point in time. Therefore remember that it's important that we're ignoring the
  # results of `clear()` and `purge()` calls in this hook, otherwise we would end
  # up in a recursive loop due to the hook system.

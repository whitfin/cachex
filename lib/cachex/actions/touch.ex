  Command module to update the touch time of cache entries.

  Touching an entry is the act of resetting the touch time to the current
  time, without affecting the expiration set against the record. As such
  it's incredibly useful for implementing least-recently used caching
  systems without breaking expiration based constracts.

  Updates the touch time of an entry inside a cache.

  Touching an entry will update the write time of the entry, but without modifying any
  expirations set on the entry. This is done by reading back the current expiration,
  and then updating the record appropriately to modify the touch time and setting the
  expiration to the offset of the two.

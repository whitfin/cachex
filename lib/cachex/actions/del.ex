  Removes an entry from a cache by key.

  This command will always return a true value, signalling that the key no longer
  exists in the cache (regardless of whether it previously existed).

  Removal runs in a lock aware context, to ensure that we're not removing a key
  being used inside a transaction in other places in the codebase.

  Checks whether any entries exist in the cache.

  Emptiness is determined by the overall size of the cache, regardless of the
  expiration times set alongside keys. This means that you may have a non-empty
  cache, yet be unable to retrieve any keys due to having lazy expiration enabled.

  Internally this action is delegated through to the `size()` command and the
  returned numeric value is just "cast" to a boolean value.

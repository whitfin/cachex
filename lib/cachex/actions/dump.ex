  Dumps a cache to disk at the given location.

  This call will return an error if anything goes wrong with writing the file;
  it is up to the caller to ensure the file is writeable using the default `File`
  interfaces.

  By default, files are written to disk with level 1 compression due to performance
  implications but the `:compression` option can be passed as an integer between
  1 and 9 (inclusive) to specify a compression level.

  Passing a 0 compressed flag will disable compression. This is way faster than
  the default compression, but the file size will increase dramatically.

  # of a cache on an as-needed basis. It should be noted that streams do not
  # currently support record expirations, although this may change in future.

  @doc """
  Creates a new `Stream` for a given cache.

  Streams are a moving window of a cache, in that they will reflect the latest
  changes in a cache once they're consumed. For example, if you create a Stream
  and consume it 15 minutes later, you'll see all changes which occurred in those
  15 minutes.

  You can provide custom structures to stream using via the `:of` option, but
  as of yet there is no way to query before consumption - meaning that you'll
  have to filter the Stream itself rather than avoiding buffering in the first
  place - this may change in future.

  We execute an `:ets.test_ms/2` call before doing anything to ensure the user
  has provided a valid return type. If they haven't, we return an error before
  creating a cursor or the `Stream` itself.
